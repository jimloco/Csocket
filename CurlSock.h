 * @brief Csocket style wrapper around libcurl-multi
 *
 * http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html
 * This isn't finished, but this is my basic approach. I added a means to which Csocket can
 * monitor file descriptors it doesn't directly control. This class hooks into that by virtue
 * of a callback "GatherFDsForSelect" and ties that libcurl-multi. When Csocket looks for fd's to
 * monitor, this class calls "curl_multi_socket_action" which does a couple things ...
 * - 1. Calls our CURL callback CCurlSock::SetupSock to let us know the FD's and what they should be monitored for
 * - 2. Calls our CURL callback CCurlSock::SetupTimer which lets us know the maxium wait time for activity
 * - 3. Process any handles that are in a ready state
 *
 * The end point here is a non-blocking method to fetch documents via CURL within Csocket
